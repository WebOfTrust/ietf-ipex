              Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol
                        draft-ssmith-ipex-latest

Abstract

   The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol provides a
   uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs
   [ACDC_ID] in a securely attributable manner.  A single protocol is
   able to work for both types of exchanges by recognizing that all
   exchanges (both issuance and presentation) may be modeled as the
   disclosure of information by a Discloser to a Disclosee.  The
   difference between exchange types is the information disclosed not
   the mechanism for disclosure.  Furthermore, the chaining mechanism of
   ACDCs and support for both targeted and untargeted ACDCs provide
   sufficient variability to accommodate the differences in applications
   or use cases without requiring a difference in the exchange protocol
   itself.  This greatly simplifies the exchange protocol.  This
   simplification has two primary advantages.  The first is enhanced
   security.  A well-delimited protocol can be designed and analyzed to
   minimize and mitigate attack mechanisms.  The second is convenience.
   A standard simple protocol is easier to implement, support, update,
   understand, and adopt.  The tooling is more consistent.

   This IPEX [IPEX_ID] protocol leverages important features of ACDCs
   and ancillary protocols such as CESR [CESR_ID], SAIDs [SAID_ID], and
   CESR-Proofs [Proof_ID] as well as Ricardian contracts [RC] and
   graduated disclosure (partial, selective, full) to enable
   contractually protected disclosure.  Contractually protected
   disclosure includes both chain-link confidential [CLC] and contingent
   disclosure [ACDC_ID].
